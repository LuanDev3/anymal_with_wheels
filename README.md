# anymal_with_wheels
This Project extends the concepts of the Anymal C robot developed by the ANYmal group and uses the simulation of this robot coupled with wheels to realize a hybrid control navigation in environments with obstacles.

## Dependecies
This project depends directly on the Anymal C simple description project developed by ANYmal that can be accessed in this [link](https://github.com/ANYbotics/anymal_c_simple_description). The second dependency is related to the world in Gazebo where the robot makes the trajectory, in order the [clearPathRobotics](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_gazebo) is used to generate the world, with the implemented physics.
